# **In all seriousness, here's why there are so many damn implementations:**

## **A writeup on my programming assignment lmfao**

### _(tl;dr is: I was in way over my head with this lol, big sadge)_

## Problem Description:

Given `p` and `t`, find number of possible 1âˆ’6 integer combinations to, when summed with `p`, reach 100, without having an increment that hits `t`.

## _My_ interpretation:

A major requirement to fulfill for this set of problems, `tugas-5`, was to do things _recursively_. _I_ interpreted this as a challenge to make it as recursive as possible, where, y'know, we shouldn't rely on `for` and `while`s, but I'll quickly realize that (as you'll see below), that's not really the case.

At least, that wasn't the hard bit. <img src="./wu-assets/Harold1.png" width="24px" height="24px" alt=":hide_the_pain:">

## So wat do?

To calculate all possible combinations, one has to track the current array of combinations and pass that to the next frame in the call stack.

Do you know what this means?  
_EXPONENTIAL GROWTH_ on the call stack, this can lead to a multitude of issues, namely _everything_. (That's got to do with memory, at least.)

Now, I knew this, but what _I_ interpreted from the problem definition, was to get _all_ combinations, and not the total number of _possible_ combinations. So, `sys.setrecursionlimit()` it is.

I realized halfway through that life would've been a much better and easier time had I taken this other route. Buuuuuut, being the egotisitical prick that I am, I tried to force my way through _anyway_, mostly because I alrd did my initial implementation (see [./100.py](./100.py)), and that it just, didn't "click" in my head to do this.

So, [after my initial implementation broke down and cried on the side of the road](#below-is-my-initial-implementation-uses-a-lot-of-memory-and-prime-example-of-what-i-meant-by-exponential-see-the-lines-that-deallocated-700-ish-mibs-lol), I tried again. The first thought that came to mind was reducing the number of memory overheads, but how?

So I did what everyone does when they get stuck, they _steal_.  
Jk, but one of my classmates, Kevin, was working on the same problem and he found an algorithm to just, get the number of possible combinations. So he came to me to confirm his programming bit, and I confirmed that it was all good, so he sent it off, and got AC.

Now, I _could_, probably should tbh in hindsight, have done his approach, which is fine in theory, I've already put this to practice in [kursi](../kursi/), but as I said above, I was way too egotistical for this.

But anyway, what I noticed, was that, his thingy, didn't use as much memory, because it didn't track a lot of parameters _(fewer things to track = less memory use? Who would've thought? Crazy amirite)_, so I tried to do the same with my implementation.

I did this, by _not_ passing all of, everything; current sequence, current result array, current memo state, etc etc.; to the next recursive call.
Instead, what I did was I only passed the current result to the next frame, and pass the `p`, current index, `t`, and the 100.

This ["worked"](#below-is-second-attempt-when-we-try-to-get-all-possible-combinations-but-reducing-number-of-memory-use-by-not-tracking-so-damn-many-function-parameters), and reduced the memory use, by a l o t. But as I quickly found out (by submitting it to DOMJudge), this wasn't going to be enough.

So wat happun nex? Do me keep tryin me bes? Do me push thru to becom da bes? Na broh, we cave in lmfao.

So I caved in, gave up on finding all possible combinations whilst staying low on memory footprint, and just, worked on that "find number of possibilities" algorithm.

After a while of trying, I arrived on a similar flow to Kevin's regardless of what I did, so I just grabbed his and added memoization + QoL to reduce the footprint even further.

## Well damn, disappointment.

Life isn't all sunshine and rainbows, sometimes enough is... enough. If everyone got everything they wanted in life, there would be no sadness. But to live is to experience life in its entirety, to accept life for all of its beauty and ugly. [To end suffering, is to end desire and attachment.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECYT7npIeMY)

Why is this section here? I don't know.

## Here are my benchmark logs for the above:

### Before memo:

    16   22.051 MiB    0.000 MiB         500           return res
```

    32   21.816 MiB    0.000 MiB          10           return res
```

### Below is second attempt, when we try to get all possible combinations, but reducing number of memory use by not tracking so damn many function parameters:

    22   22.363 MiB    0.000 MiB        3000           return ways
```

### Below is my initial implementation, uses a lot of memory and prime example of what I meant by "exponential" (see the lines that deallocated 700-ish MiBs lol):
